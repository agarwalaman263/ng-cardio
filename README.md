# NG-Cardio (pronounced as ng-card-IO)

Ng-cardio is an angular library used for generating card views for angular applications. The cards ae completely responsive and helps the developers to lower his burden of maintaining card views plus removes the hassle for creating the CSS for cards. 

The library styling is based on CSS entirely and doesnot rqeuire to overload the JS engine to module styling.

###### Currently the library consists 3 types of cards with limited deep controls. The library is completely open sourced and contributers are most welcome to raise the PR.

The live demonstration of the library is presented on my portfolio. Kindly view it :-
